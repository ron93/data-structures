Data Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of focussing on important aspects of an object while filtering out the unwanted aspects.

Data abstraction is the development of classes,objects, types in terms of their interfaces and functionality, instead of their implementation details. The process of abstraction is called modelling. Developers use abstraction to decompose complex into smmaller components and this gives them the ability to foresee the expected functionality of the undeveloped system.

abstract data types

Its is a mathematical model for a certain class of data structures that have similar behavior; or for certain data types of one or more programming languages that have similar semantics. An abstract data type is defined indirectly, only by the operations that may be performed on it and by mathematical constraints on the effects (and possibly cost) of those operations.

arrays

It is an object that contains elements of similar data type. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only fixed set of elements in a java array.

Array in java is index based, first element of the array is stored at 0 index.
